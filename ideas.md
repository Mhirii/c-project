## Ideas  


### Flashcard System with Spaced Repetition

#### Context  
 A flashcard is a small piece of paper with a question on one side and the answer on the other,
 It is meant to help you learn a new concept or skill by testing yourself on the question and answer.
 Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing material at increasing intervals.

#### How it works  
 The idea is to review the flashcards at increasing intervals, starting with a short interval and gradually increasing it over time.
 This helps to make the learning process more efficient and effective by ensuring that you review the material regularly.

#### Core Functionality  
Create, read, update, and delete flashcards (front and back text).

#### Unique Features
Implement a spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., Leitner system) to schedule card reviews based on user performance. Store review schedules per card.


### Password Manager

#### Context  
A password manager is a software application that helps users create, store, and manage passwords securely.
It provides a centralized location for storing and accessing passwords, making it easier to generate and use unique passwords for different accounts.

#### How it works  
The password manager allows users to create, store, and manage passwords for multiple accounts.
It provides a secure way to generate and use unique passwords for each account, ensuring that the passwords are not easily guessable or guessed by attackers.

#### Core Functionality  
Create, read, update, and delete passwords and keys.
Generate and use unique passwords for each account.


### Data Encryption/Decryption Tool

#### Context  
Data encryption is the process of converting data into a format that is unreadable without a decryption key.
Data decryption is the process of converting data from a format that is unreadable without a decryption key back into its original form.

#### How it works  
The data encryption/decryption tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt data using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
It provides a secure way to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.

#### Core Functionality  
Encrypt and decrypt data using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
Provide a secure way to protect sensitive information.


### Simple Code Indexer
#### Core Functionality  
Index code files (e.g., C source files) by function names.
#### Unique Features
+ Provide a way to search for specific functions within the code files by partial function name.
+ Filter by file type, file path, function signature, and amount of calls.
+ Fast Search: Use a hash table to map function names to file location and line number

### A Management System (e.g. School)
#### Context  
A school management system is a software application that helps schools manage their students, teachers, and other staff.
It provides a centralized platform for organizing and managing school-related activities, such as scheduling, attendance, and grades.

#### Core Functionality  
Create, read, update, and delete entities.
Track attendance and grades.

#### Unique Features
+ Implement a scheduling algorithm to automatically generate schedules based on student needs and preferences.
+ Provide a way to view attendance and grades for individual students and teachers.
+ Allow teachers to create and manage assignments, quizzes, and tests.
+ Implement a grading algorithm to automatically assign grades based on student performance.
